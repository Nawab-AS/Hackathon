  <h1> What are Banks? <br/>Why do I need to store my money in a bank?</h1>

  <p>A bank is a business that accepts deposits and makes loans. When your money is in an insured bank, you don’t have
    to worry about it being lost or stolen; it will be safe until you are ready to use it.</p>
  <p>When you put your money in a bank, it is safe. You don’t have to worry about a fire or a flood destroying your
    money. You also don’t have to worry about misplacing your money or anyone taking it if it is safely kept in the
    bank.</p>

  <h1>Goals and Savings </h1>
  <h2>What are goals? Why are they important?</h2>

  <p>Goals are things you want to achieve or accomplish. They can be short-term, like by the end of the month, or
    long-term, like by the time you are old enough to drive. </p>

  <p>Goals are important because they help you achieve your goals. They can also help you keep track of your goals</p>2
