    keep track of how much money you earn, how much you spend, and how much you have saved. It can help clarify between
    wants and needs.</p>

  <p>A need is something you cannot live without, like clothes. A want is something you would like to have but can live
    without, such as a new guitar. A budget has 3 parts, income, expenses and savings. You should spend 50% of your
    income on needs, 30% on want and 20% on wants.</p>
